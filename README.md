# MATC15-Project - Diophantine Equations to the Power of $n$

> by Andrew D'Amario, Kevin Santos, and Dawson Brown © Winter 2021

The objective of this project is to investigate the conjecture above: whether or not we can always find at least one integer solution to equations of the form $x^n=y_1^n+...+y_n^n$ given any $x$, excluding trivial solutions involving $y_i$'s$=0$ or $x^1$.

Some of this investigation and research will involve:
- Finding parameters and conditions for possible valid solutions
- Computational analysis on random integers raised to the power of $n$ and finding an integer solution to the sum.
- Noting differences between even and odd $n$.
- Identifying different families of solutions that take on a similar form.

Though this conjecture may be false, we hope to investigate as much as we can on the matter, as well as summarize and provide some deeper research to the subject.
